Il avait laissé une note de suicide, comme quoi des mots avaient été dit qui ne correspondait pas à la réalité<br />\n<br />\nQue s'est il passé?</p>\n    <p>J'apprend le suicide le week-end, la semaine reprend avec des audiences au parquet de Bruxelles.<br />\n<br />\nL'avocat de Spatz annonce le suicide de FM en faisant une corrélation avec la mise en ligne du documentaire L'école en Bateau sur mon blog, très clairement entrain de m'accuser</p>\n    <p>Du suicide de cet homme pour lequel je n'avais jamais eu même la moindre pensée de haine, encore moins lui souhaiter un suicide ou ce qui l'aurait soit disant provoqué : la suggestion qu'il aurait eu des actes d'abus pédocriminel envers moi ou mes amis.</p>\n    <p>J'étais choqué.. Non seulement j'avais reçu une photo d'un adepte OKC avec FM sur un civière, comme pour dire, voilà ce que t'as fait.. Comme en plus, en tribunal, on venait me coller la raison de son suicide sur le dos.. C'était pas juste minable, machiavélique, vicieux. C'était</p>\n    <p>Tout simplement malveillant, dessiné pour détruire ma crédibilité, mes intentions et celles <a class=\"entity-mention\" href=\"https://twitter.com/OKCinfor\">@OKCinfor</a><br />\nC'était machiavélique, de la pure malice, (cet homme est magistrat aujourd'hui) c'était diabolique. J'étais paralysé, hébété, en état de choc. En plein tribunal.</p>\n    <p>Par la suite j'ai pu m'expliquer devant la cour, mes intentions, corrélation n'est pas causation et je pense que la cour n'était pas dupe, ce passage à été mis aux oubliettes et n'a plus jamais été utilisé contre moi ou nous par la suite.. Mais.. Ça m'est resté en travers...</p>\n    <p>Fast forward 2 ans plus tard, nouveau procès en appel, 8 mois de procédures à Liège, un dossier de plus de 400 pièces est déposé par la OKC et l'avocat de Spatz pour \"illustrer\" la défense OKC (je passe les détails) sur le moment je ne fouille pas ce dossier de pièce. J'oublie.</p>\n    <p>Fast forward 2 ans de plus, le pourvoi en cassation a été rejeté, Robert Spatz est condamné à 5 ans avec sursis, la OKC en partie acquittée, et nous sommes déjà en France, l'instruction suit son cours.. Et puis il y a quelques semaines je me met à explorer ce dossier de pièces</p>\n    <p>Et je tombe sur quoi ?<br />\n- lettre d'aveux de FM au tribunal<br />\n- note de suicide<br />\n<br />\nDeux pièces JAMAIS utilisée par la défense depuis 2016.<br />\n<br />\nJ'ose même pas ouvrir le PDF<br />\n<br />\nUn soir je me lance, je décide de lire cette lettre.</p>\n    <p>Contexte : ce n'est pas son écriture, ce n'est pas son français (il avait un terrible frantugnol) ce n'est pas ses mots, un avocat est obligatoirement passé dessus, a potentiellement remanié, rephrasé, refondu cette lettre. Des aveux, dans le déni, mais des aveux quand même.</p>\n    <p>Contexte 2 : avant son suicide, avant le procès, FM aurait voulu quitter Château de Soleil, rejoindre sa famille au Portugal, peut-être déménager complètement.<br />\n<br />\nIl n'a jamais reçu le soutien pour le faire, après plus de 30 ans au service de <a class=\"entity-mention\" href=\"https://twitter.com/OgyenKun\">@OgyenKun</a></p>\n    <p>Quand le procès est arrivé, il s'est retrouvé exclu, ostracisé, pointé du doigt, après tout, si la \"Communauté\" était sur la touche c'était à cause de sa violence à l'égard des enfants, potentiellement que des rumeurs sur ce qu'on avait déclaré en tribunal ont été déformée</p>\n    <p>Il n'avait JAMAIS été question d'abus sexuels sur les garçons venant de la part de FM, c'était plus que clair pour la cour, mais quid de la OKC ? Qui dans la OKC lui a laissé croire qu'il y avait plus, quel soutient psychologique lui a été fourni pour faire face à ces faits ?</p>\n    <p>Aucun, FM a été laissé seul face à ses crimes de tortures sur des enfants, il a été utilisé en tribunal contre nous, sa lettre d'aveux n'a jamais été utilisée car même après nettoyage des avocats, elle était incriminante, elle montrait un homme en déni, sur ses propres actes.</p>\n    <p>Jamais je n'oublierai l'utilisation d'un suicidé de la secte, contre ses victimes, pour essayer de les déstabiliser. Jamais je n'oublierais cet \"avocat\" devenu quasi adepte de Robert Spatz en quelques mois de procédures, combien de Millions d'euros à t'il gagné ? <a class=\"entity-hashtag\" href=\"/hashtag/diabolique\">#diabolique</a></p>\n    <p>Jamais je n'oublierai le manque total d'objectivité, face à la gravité des accusations, des crimes, énoncé devant la cour et sa mise en service de ses capacités de droits au service d'un pédocriminel. Un être vil qui en 7 ans de procédure n'aura montré que dédain et déni.</p>\n    <p>Comme son Maître. Prêt à tout pour détruire les parties civiles, sans la moindre objectivité, tel un chien au service d'un Maître maléfique. Jamais je n'oublierais cette scène et j'espère qu'un jour, ce magistrat se rendra compte de ce qu'il a défendu. Au mépris de la raison. Fin</p>\n    <p><a class=\"entity-mention entity-mention-first\" href=\"https://twitter.com/threadreaderapp\">@threadreaderapp</a> unroll</p>\n    <p>J'avais envie de raconter cette histoire depuis des semaines.. Pour m'en libérer, car ça peut paraître dingue (et les photos de nous même utilisée contre nous en tribunal par la secte le démontre) aucun d'entre nous n'avait de la haine pour FM, il était le produit d'un système</p>\n    <p>Il n'y avait pas de haine à avoir pour un pion d'un système et d'ailleurs en \"bon bouddhiste\" à l'époque, je lui ai serré la main, comme pour braver le passé, lui montrer qu'il ne pouvait plus me faire de mal, tout en cultivant l'intention de la compassion à son égard.</p>\n    <p>Les rapports n'était plus les mêmes, j'étais de visite sur place en vacance, libre de la secte, revenu poser les pieds sur ce lieu en me disant que c'était un adieu, fier de ne jamais y laisser ma progéniture éventuelle. Comme revenir au lieux des ténèbres pour mieux les chasser</p>\n    <p>Que FM repose en paix, car si il y a un coupable de ce suicide, c'est l'organisation OKC qui l'a ensuite utilisé pour ses besoins de défense assis sur du vide. Contre les victimes.<br />\n<br />\nEt ça se prétend Bouddhiste. 🤮</p>\n    <p><a class=\"entity-mention entity-mention-first\" href=\"https://twitter.com/threadreaderapp\">@threadreaderapp</a> unroll</p>\n</div>\n",

Non seulement j'avais reçu une photo d'un adepte OKC avec FM sur un civière, comme pour dire, voilà ce que t'as fait.. Comme en plus, en tribunal, on venait me coller la raison de son suicide sur le dos.. C'était pas juste minable, machiavélique, vicieux. C'était</p>\n    <p>Tout simplement malveillant, dessiné pour détruire ma crédibilité, mes intentions et celles <a class=\"entity-mention\" href=\"https://twitter.com/OKCinfor\">@OKCinfor</a><br />\nC'était machiavélique, de la pure malice, (cet homme est magistrat aujourd'hui) c'était diabolique. J'étais paralysé, hébété, en état de choc. En plein tribunal.</p>\n    <p>Par la suite j'ai pu m'expliquer devant la cour, mes intentions, corrélation n'est pas causation et je pense que la cour n'était pas dupe, ce passage à été mis aux oubliettes et n'a plus jamais été utilisé contre moi ou nous par la suite.. Mais.. Ça m'est resté en travers...</p>\n    <p>Fast forward 2 ans plus tard, nouveau procès en appel, 8 mois de procédures à Liège, un dossier de plus de 400 pièces est déposé par la OKC et l'avocat de Spatz pour \"illustrer\" la défense OKC (je passe les détails) sur le moment je ne fouille pas ce dossier de pièce. J'oublie.</p>\n    <p>Fast forward 2 ans de plus, le pourvoi en cassation a été rejeté, Robert Spatz est condamné à 5 ans avec sursis, la OKC en partie acquittée, et nous sommes déjà en France, l'instruction suit son cours.. Et puis il y a quelques semaines je me met à explorer ce dossier de pièces</p>\n    <p>Et je tombe sur quoi ?<br />\n- lettre d'aveux de FM au tribunal<br />\n- note de suicide<br />\n<br />\nDeux pièces JAMAIS utilisée par la défense depuis 2016.<br />\n<br />\nJ'ose même pas ouvrir le PDF<br />\n<br />\nUn soir je me lance, je décide de lire cette lettre.</p>\n    <p>Contexte : ce n'est pas son écriture, ce n'est pas son français (il avait un terrible frantugnol) ce n'est pas ses mots, un avocat est obligatoirement passé dessus, a potentiellement remanié, rephrasé, refondu cette lettre. Des aveux, dans le déni, mais des aveux quand même.</p>\n    <p>Contexte 2 : avant son suicide, avant le procès, FM aurait voulu quitter Château de Soleil, rejoindre sa famille au Portugal, peut-être déménager complètement.<br />\n<br />\nIl n'a jamais reçu le soutien pour le faire, après plus de 30 ans au service de <a class=\"entity-mention\" href=\"https://twitter.com/OgyenKun\">@OgyenKun</a></p>\n    <p>Quand le procès est arrivé, il s'est retrouvé exclu, ostracisé, pointé du doigt, après tout, si la \"Communauté\" était sur la touche c'était à cause de sa violence à l'égard des enfants, potentiellement que des rumeurs sur ce qu'on avait déclaré en tribunal ont été déformée</p>\n    <p>Il n'avait JAMAIS été question d'abus sexuels sur les garçons venant de la part de FM, c'était plus que clair pour la cour, mais quid de la OKC ? Qui dans la OKC lui a laissé croire qu'il y avait plus, quel soutient psychologique lui a été fourni pour faire face à ces faits ?</p>\n    <p>Aucun, FM a été laissé seul face à ses crimes de tortures sur des enfants, il a été utilisé en tribunal contre nous, sa lettre d'aveux n'a jamais été utilisée car même après nettoyage des avocats, elle était incriminante, elle montrait un homme en déni, sur ses propres actes.</p>\n    <p>Jamais je n'oublierai l'utilisation d'un suicidé de la secte, contre ses victimes, pour essayer de les déstabiliser. Jamais je n'oublierais cet \"avocat\" devenu quasi adepte de Robert Spatz en quelques mois de procédures, combien de Millions d'euros à t'il gagné ? <a class=\"entity-hashtag\" href=\"/hashtag/diabolique\">#diabolique</a></p>\n    <p>Jamais je n'oublierai le manque total d'objectivité, face à la gravité des accusations, des crimes, énoncé devant la cour et sa mise en service de ses capacités de droits au service d'un pédocriminel. Un être vil qui en 7 ans de procédure n'aura montré que dédain et déni.</p>\n    <p>Comme son Maître. Prêt à tout pour détruire les parties civiles, sans la moindre objectivité, tel un chien au service d'un Maître maléfique. Jamais je n'oublierais cette scène et j'espère qu'un jour, ce magistrat se rendra compte de ce qu'il a défendu. Au mépris de la raison. Fin</p>\n    <p><a class=\"entity-mention entity-mention-first\" href=\"https://twitter.com/threadreaderapp\">@threadreaderapp</a> unroll</p>\n    <p>J'avais envie de raconter cette histoire depuis des semaines.. Pour m'en libérer, car ça peut paraître dingue (et les photos de nous même utilisée contre nous en tribunal par la secte le démontre) aucun d'entre nous n'avait de la haine pour FM, il était le produit d'un système</p>\n    <p>Il n'y avait pas de haine à avoir pour un pion d'un système et d'ailleurs en \"bon bouddhiste\" à l'époque, je lui ai serré la main, comme pour braver le passé, lui montrer qu'il ne pouvait plus me faire de mal, tout en cultivant l'intention de la compassion à son égard.</p>\n    <p>Les rapports n'était plus les mêmes, j'étais de visite sur place en vacance, libre de la secte, revenu poser les pieds sur ce lieu en me disant que c'était un adieu, fier de ne jamais y laisser ma progéniture éventuelle. Comme revenir au lieux des ténèbres pour mieux les chasser</p>\n    <p>Que FM repose en paix, car si il y a un coupable de ce suicide, c'est l'organisation OKC qui l'a ensuite utilisé pour ses besoins de défense assis sur du vide. Contre les victimes.<br />\n<br />\nEt ça se prétend Bouddhiste. 🤮</p>\n    <p><a class=\"entity-mention entity-mention-first\" href=\"https://twitter.com/threadreaderapp\">@threadreaderapp</a> unroll</p>\n</div>\n",

We also wanted to experiment with search and distributed technologies, and, of course, we had a desire to read.</p>\n<p>Three years ago, we created a Telegram bot called Nexus that mirrors books and scientific publications from Library Genesis. Telegram of 2020 was a welcoming house, and we spent the past three years productively. The bot acquired the capability to provide access to new papers in the end of 2021, which was especially useful as Sci-Hub stopped doing so, linked Z-Library books in 2022, and even fought against a stupid Indian publishing house that bombarded us with claims in 2022/23 (the traces of the fight are remembered by the name of the currently working Telegram bots). Over time, Nexus Bots became a convenient way to find papers, given the blocks happening here and there on the wild Web.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ycwwsn4sj8sa1.png?width=1638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e892bc8e0e062b20d90f767b7b0e1de988562e76\">TorrentFreak about us, unwillingly confused with Z-Library</a></p>\n<p>But the most important changes are about to become a reality. Here, I would like to summarise all that we have done and highlight essential details that our users are still unaware of. We have never had enough time to promote ourselves rapidly (the team is small, sometimes small to the most degenerate size possible), and I hope this post will answer several asked questions about Nexus.</p>\n<p><strong>Inside the Nexus Search</strong></p>\n<p>Bots are just the face of Nexus and every your search query is served by the search engine, the heart with the name Nexus Search. Originally, the first versions of Nexus Search were based on Postgres tables, but their search capabilities were too sad. As a result, we used a dedicated search software that has been the core of Nexus for years, namely <a href=\"https://github.com/izihawa/summa\">Summa</a>.</p>\n<p>This is the reason why Nexus does not publish SQL dumps like LibGen - there are no such dumps because there is no SQL server behind - but publishes data dumps in binary format of Summa that can be <a href=\"https://stdtc-eth.ipns.dweb.link/#/replication\">downloaded</a>, <a href=\"https://izihawa.github.io/summa/blog/mitigating-internet-censorship-and-privacy-issues/\">attached</a> and used directly in this search engine.</p>\n<p>If you want to explore the landscape of scholarly publications, you can freely use Nexus Search as a replacement for the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/2022-public-data-file-of-more-than-134-million-metadata-records-now-available/\">CrossRef Database</a>. It does not contain all fields that exist in CrossRef but provides the most important ones required for search, such as title, authors, abstract, journal name, ISSN/ISBN/DOI identifiers. Nexus Search also contains cross-references, allowing users to explore graph properties of scholarly publications. And not a single asshole such as Elsevier will be <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151117/09383132839/elsevier-says-downloading-content-mining-licensed-copies-research-papers-could-be-considered-stealing.shtml\">capable to interrupt you</a>.</p>\n<p>Summa search engine provides many opportunities for researchers. It allows you to perform aggregation queries to conduct analytics, and export documents into JSON much faster than any SQL database if you want to use data in other databases. In addition, we have calculated PageRank for all papers up to 2023 year and extracted text layers for top-downloaded 350k articles, providing valuable data for researchers.</p>\n<p>Our next goal is to reliably distribute scholar data across the globe using IPFS, after which we plan to extract all text layers. Together with search, it will open doors for people to train AI on various scientific topics or even on the entire corpus of science.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Nexus Search contains IPFS content identifiers (CIDs) for almost all books and for a lot of recent papers that are absent in many known libraries. CIDs make possible for users to download PDFs directly through the IPFS network. The collection of CIDs nowadays are not very large but constantly growing up.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>A several words about IPFS, a system similar to BitTorrent. With IPFS, you can get an identifier for your file and pass it to other people, who can then download the file directly from your computer using the identifier. After that, they can become a source of the file for others too. This means that files can spread like a</em> <em><del>digital</del></em> <em>disease. This is exactly what we need to ensure that knowledge is replicated reliably. If we can put scholarly papers on IPFS, store their identifiers to the search database and then put the search database on IPFS too, and then ensure that people use and replicate Nexus Search on their computers, our goal of knowledge preservation will be achieved.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Important:</strong> Nexus Search does not contain CIDs for <em>all</em> scimag items, though we are going to add them. Our focus is on items, absent in scimag and other collections: recent papers and the most important papers of the past.</p>\n<p>Nexus Search is a valuable database, but users need a way to access its information. While it is possible to <a href=\"http://standard-template-construct.org/#/replication\">download and deploy</a> the data on a local search server, this process is not always comfortable for most people. Therefore, Nexus Search requires a front-end. The original method of accessing Nexus Search was through already mentioned Nexus Bots.</p>\n<p><strong>A Breed Of Nexus Bots</strong></p>\n<p>Bots exist on Telegram, and you must be a registered user of this messenger to use them. Legal restrictions have compelled us to remove direct links to the bots, but they can be easily found if you navigate through our social media pages (linked at the end).</p>\n<p>Bots are widely used, can be cloned, and provide a rather rich query syntax to request what you need. The only remaining issue is that it is still Telegram, a proprietary and closed system that may ban us or disappear one day.</p>\n<p>To mitigate our dependency on the proprietary system, we have started to build Standard Template Construct on the basis of existing distributed technologies to ensure that the flow of knowledge will never stop.</p>\n<p><strong>Standard Template Construct</strong></p>\n<p>Named after the imaginary computational machine of the Warhammer 40,000 universe, Standard Template Construct (STC) is an IPFS-backed web-site that touted as the most reliable way to access knowledge. Here is a brief introduction to what it is, how to use it, and why it is important.</p>\n<p>Nexus Search, the main database behind STC, was already put to IPFS for replication purposes. But we have moved further and used a search engine that also may be executed within static sites, doing all search operations inside your browser. Such a search engine can be put to IPFS too and access Nexus Search living in IPFS.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the field of IT, there is a concept of a network drive, which acts like a physical drive but is accessed over a network. Most databases store their files on drives and can store files on network drives as well. IPFS can also be considered as a large, reliable and slow network drive, which means, in theory, that any database can be launched over IPFS. In practice, this depends on how the database accesses its files. For instance, if the database reads many small intervals of its files, this pattern can be inefficient because every read is translated to a network request. We have worked hard to reduce the number of reads in our database, making STC usable over network drives and IPFS in practice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This means that all the necessary components to access Nexus Search are available in IPFS. There is no need for a dedicated search server or website to execute your search request, and therefore accessing papers can be done <strong>without the involvement of centralized services</strong>. All you have to do is to open STC through IPFS, perform a search, and then to download your book or paper through its CID that is also stored in Nexus Search.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/n0ah8dewj8sa1.jpg?width=1629&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=33accdd682c9b637a49896b4a0c393c06fc05a18\">Who entirely replicated STC since several days after release</a></p>\n<p>By using STC you are also becoming a seeder of database and stored items. It happens because of the way how IPFS is working: after getting a data, your IPFS instance starts to distribute it further.</p>\n<p>This also means that no one will be able to collect logs on your search queries or sell your personal data to a third party. IPFS makes you the owner of the database and search engine, significantly enhancing your privacy.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Access STC</strong></p>\n<p>Before you begin, please keep in mind that we are still in the process of developing STC. We&rsquo;ve done our best to reduce network requirements, but you should be aware that opening the 70GB search database will require you to download 20-30MB on your first visit after which it will be cached, and 0.5-1.5MB for each search thereafter.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that we do not currently support Safari versions prior to 16.4, and we have not tested STC on every possible browser. Unfortunately, it is also required to disable Brave Shields (if you use Brave browser) as it breaks subdomain queries that are normal for many sites. Refresh page if it hangs (and report us about it).</p>\n<p>The first thing you need to know is that STC is a static site, meaning it doesn&rsquo;t require any API or remote server. Once you&rsquo;ve retrieved the site files through IPFS, your browser can render the site, and you can start making search queries. All search requests are served locally or through interaction with IPFS.</p>\n<p>So the main issue is how to receive STC to your browser. In general, IPFS supposes two antagonistic ways of how you may open static sites hosted on it:</p>\n<p><em>Public Gateway</em></p>\n<p>IPFS is a separate network and to access it, you need to have <a href=\"https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/ipfs-desktop/\">IPFS Desktop installed</a>. To address the case when you have no way to install IPFS locally (e.g. iPhone, restricted environments, casual users who do not care about this fancy technology), the authors invested in creating public gateways that allow to access IPFS through HTTP. You may use such a public gateway without installing IPFS, but you should remember that there are many other users who think the same way, creating incredible pressure on public gateway sites. Hence, gateways usually work very slowly. Moreover, <a href=\"https://torrentfreak.com/cloudflare-disables-access-to-pirated-content-on-its-ipfs-gateway-230324/\">public gateways are the first subjects for censorship</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Local IPFS Daemon</em></p>\n<p>The more preferable option is to <a href=\"https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/ipfs-desktop/\">install IPFS Desktop</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/ipfs-companion/\">IPFS Companion</a>. Then, you will have direct access to IPFS, which is more performant and reliable.</p>\n<p>Now, after you have chosen between Public Gateway and Local IPFS Daemon, you are ready to open STC, but before that, you need to learn its name in IPFS network. IPFS provides non-human-readable identifiers called CIDs for all stored entities which are unique for every stored entity and also is generated automatically.</p>\n<p>Every particular version of the STC has its own identifier. It&rsquo;s important to underline that CIDs are immutable, so visiting the site by its CID means you will get the same version of the site every time. But what if we add new features or upload new papers to STC? New versions of STC will have new CIDs and to help you find the actual CIDs of new versions, we have registered the domain name: <a href=\"http://standard-template-construct.org\">standard-template-construct.org</a></p>\n<p>Here you are, opened the Standard Template Construct and ready to read. Put in the search bar DOI or text query, navigate through what you have found and download it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/c6ixygoog8sa1.png?width=2412&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5c6fac36824f55a4e03fe35ebc1f893656e89b14\">Recent versions of STC</a></p>\n<p><strong>How to help us?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Easy mode</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You may join <a href=\"https://t.me/nexus_search\">our Telegram</a> where we publish DOI-CIDs lists which is enough to help us with seeding and to start your own library.

				"content_text": "I'm storing this here because people need to find this and have access to this and help relay this, it's too important that knowledge be shared and accessible. \n\nPasted from Reddit Scihub sub\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/scihub/comments/12detqs/standard_template_construct_store_and_search_the/\n\nWe are creating [free, unblockable, and easily clonable library](http://standard-template-construct.org/) for both people and machines, living entirely in IPFS and working without any centralised server. It's already functional and provides access to many contemporary scholarly works that are missing from other free libraries.\n\nThe site does not host any illegal content - there is no any site in a classical meaning - but just guides you through what already has been stored in IPFS :)\n\n**History**\n\nEven leaving aside these already well-known claims that knowledge should be free, I was personally insulted when saw something like this:\n\n[Would you pay 40€ for the names of potato overlords? Are they afraid to be death noted and hiding behind the paywall? ](https://preview.redd.it/s0g4mcyjj8sa1.jpg?width=2300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7454e1995eedb7fed154768c16a4e82e22e93d9b)\n\nBut formally, we have always been keeping in mind that\n\n* Unrestricted access to all knowledge is necessary for emerging new (semi-)digital lifeforms, such as AI and cyborgs\n* The free flow of information promotes growth, while restriction leads to stagnation and starvation\n* Withholding knowledge further perpetuates inequal opportunities amongst individuals and nations\n* In the event of potential armageddon, private knowledge will not survive. However, freely replicating knowledge will serve as resurrection points for fallen civilizations\n* Colonizing new worlds will require a reliable replication of knowledge, which is hardened by copyright\n\nAll these reasons have led to the creation of Nexus, the search engine and the group of people with the same name aimed at fighting against copyright in science through the most famous tool available when other ones are failing - the riot, namely digital riot. We also wanted to experiment with search and distributed technologies, and, of course, we had a desire to read.\n\nThree years ago, we created a Telegram bot called Nexus that mirrors books and scientific publications from Library Genesis. Telegram of 2020 was a welcoming house, and we spent the past three years productively. The bot acquired the capability to provide access to new papers in the end of 2021, which was especially useful as Sci-Hub stopped doing so, linked Z-Library books in 2022, and even fought against a stupid Indian publishing house that bombarded us with claims in 2022/23 (the traces of the fight are remembered by the name of the currently working Telegram bots). Over time, Nexus Bots became a convenient way to find papers, given the blocks happening here and there on the wild Web.\n\n[TorrentFreak about us, unwillingly confused with Z-Library](https://preview.redd.it/ycwwsn4sj8sa1.png?width=1638&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e892bc8e0e062b20d90f767b7b0e1de988562e76)\n\nBut the most important changes are about to become a reality. Here, I would like to summarise all that we have done and highlight essential details that our users are still unaware of. We have never had enough time to promote ourselves rapidly (the team is small, sometimes small to the most degenerate size possible), and I hope this post will answer several asked questions about Nexus.\n\n**Inside the Nexus Search**\n\nBots are just the face of Nexus and every your search query is served by the search engine, the heart with the name Nexus Search. Originally, the first versions of Nexus Search were based on Postgres tables, but their search capabilities were too sad. As a result, we used a dedicated search software that has been the core of Nexus for years, namely [Summa](https://github.com/izihawa/summa).\n\nThis is the reason why Nexus does not publish SQL dumps like LibGen - there are no such dumps because there is no SQL server behind - but publishes data dumps in binary format of Summa that can be [downloaded](https://stdtc-eth.ipns.dweb.link/#/replication), [attached](https://izihawa.github.io/summa/blog/mitigating-internet-censorship-and-privacy-issues/) and used directly in this search engine.\n\nIf you want to explore the landscape of scholarly publications, you can freely use Nexus Search as a replacement for the [CrossRef Database](https://www.crossref.org/blog/2022-public-data-file-of-more-than-134-million-metadata-records-now-available/). It does not contain all fields that exist in CrossRef but provides the most important ones required for search, such as title, authors, abstract, journal name, ISSN/ISBN/DOI identifiers. Nexus Search also contains cross-references, allowing users to explore graph properties of scholarly publications. And not a single asshole such as Elsevier will be [capable to interrupt you](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151117/09383132839/elsevier-says-downloading-content-mining-licensed-copies-research-papers-could-be-considered-stealing.shtml).\n\nSumma search engine provides many opportunities for researchers. It allows you to perform aggregation queries to conduct analytics, and export documents into JSON much faster than any SQL database if you want to use data in other databases. In addition, we have calculated PageRank for all papers up to 2023 year and extracted text layers for top-downloaded 350k articles, providing valuable data for researchers.\n\nOur next goal is to reliably distribute scholar data across the globe using IPFS, after which we plan to extract all text layers. Together with search, it will open doors for people to train AI on various scientific topics or even on the entire corpus of science.\n\nAdditionally, Nexus Search contains IPFS content identifiers (CIDs) for almost all books and for a lot of recent papers that are absent in many known libraries. CIDs make possible for users to download PDFs directly through the IPFS network. The collection of CIDs nowadays are not very large but constantly growing up.  \n\n\n>*A several words about IPFS, a system similar to BitTorrent. With IPFS, you can get an identifier for your file and pass it to other people, who can then download the file directly from your computer using the identifier. After that, they can become a source of the file for others too. This means that files can spread like a* *~~digital~~* *disease. This is exactly what we need to ensure that knowledge is replicated reliably. If we can put scholarly papers on IPFS, store their identifiers to the search database and then put the search database on IPFS too, and then ensure that people use and replicate Nexus Search on their computers, our goal of knowledge preservation will be achieved.*\n\n**Important:** Nexus Search does not contain CIDs for *all* scimag items, though we are going to add them. Our focus is on items, absent in scimag and other collections: recent papers and the most important papers of the past.\n\nNexus Search is a valuable database, but users need a way to access its information. While it is possible to [download and deploy](http://standard-template-construct.org/#/replication) the data on a local search server, this process is not always comfortable for most people. Therefore, Nexus Search requires a front-end. The original method of accessing Nexus Search was through already mentioned Nexus Bots.\n\n**A Breed Of Nexus Bots**\n\nBots exist on Telegram, and you must be a registered user of this messenger to use them. Legal restrictions have compelled us to remove direct links to the bots, but they can be easily found if you navigate through our social media pages (linked at the end).\n\nBots are widely used, can be cloned, and provide a rather rich query syntax to request what you need. The only remaining issue is that it is still Telegram, a proprietary and closed system that may ban us or disappear one day.\n\nTo mitigate our dependency on the proprietary system, we have started to build Standard Template Construct on the basis of existing distributed technologies to ensure that the flow of knowledge will never stop.\n\n**Standard Template Construct**\n\nNamed after the imaginary computational machine of the Warhammer 40,000 universe, Standard Template Construct (STC) is an IPFS-backed web-site that touted as the most reliable way to access knowledge. Here is a brief introduction to what it is, how to use it, and why it is important.\n\nNexus Search, the main database behind STC, was already put to IPFS for replication purposes. But we have moved further and used a search engine that also may be executed within static sites, doing all search operations inside your browser. Such a search engine can be put to IPFS too and access Nexus Search living in IPFS.  \n\n\n>In the field of IT, there is a concept of a network drive, which acts like a physical drive but is accessed over a network. Most databases store their files on drives and can store files on network drives as well. IPFS can also be considered as a large, reliable and slow network drive, which means, in theory, that any database can be launched over IPFS. In practice, this depends on how the database accesses its files. For instance, if the database reads many small intervals of its files, this pattern can be inefficient because every read is translated to a network request. We have worked hard to reduce the number of reads in our database, making STC usable over network drives and IPFS in practice.\n\nThis means that all the necessary components to access Nexus Search are available in IPFS. There is no need for a dedicated search server or website to execute your search request, and therefore accessing papers can be done **without the involvement of centralized services**. All you have to do is to open STC through IPFS, perform a search, and then to download your book or paper through its CID that is also stored in Nexus Search.\n\n[Who entirely replicated STC since several days after release](https://preview.redd.it/n0ah8dewj8sa1.jpg?width=1629&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=33accdd682c9b637a49896b4a0c393c06fc05a18)\n\nBy using STC you are also becoming a seeder of database and stored items. It happens because of the way how IPFS is working: after getting a data, your IPFS instance starts to distribute it further.\n\nThis also means that no one will be able to collect logs on your search queries or sell your personal data to a third party. IPFS makes you the owner of the database and search engine, significantly enhancing your privacy.\n\n**How to Access STC**\n\nBefore you begin, please keep in mind that we are still in the process of developing STC. We've done our best to reduce network requirements, but you should be aware that opening the 70GB search database will require you to download 20-30MB on your first visit after which it will be cached, and 0.5-1.5MB for each search thereafter.\n\nIt's also worth noting that we do not currently support Safari versions prior to 16.4, and we have not tested STC on every possible browser. Unfortunately, it is also required to disable Brave Shields (if you use Brave browser) as it breaks subdomain queries that are normal for many sites. Refresh page if it hangs (and report us about it).\n\nThe first thing you need to know is that STC is a static site, meaning it doesn't require any API or remote server. Once you've retrieved the site files through IPFS, your browser can render the site, and you can start making search queries. All search requests are served locally or through interaction with IPFS.\n\nSo the main issue is how to receive STC to your browser. In general, IPFS supposes two antagonistic ways of how you may open static sites hosted on it:\n\n*Public Gateway*\n\nIPFS is a separate network and to access it, you need to have [IPFS Desktop installed](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/ipfs-desktop/). To address the case when you have no way to install IPFS locally (e.g. iPhone, restricted environments, casual users who do not care about this fancy technology), the authors invested in creating public gateways that allow to access IPFS through HTTP. You may use such a public gateway without installing IPFS, but you should remember that there are many other users who think the same way, creating incredible pressure on public gateway sites. Hence, gateways usually work very slowly. Moreover, [public gateways are the first subjects for censorship](https://torrentfreak.com/cloudflare-disables-access-to-pirated-content-on-its-ipfs-gateway-230324/).\n\n*Local IPFS Daemon*\n\nThe more preferable option is to [install IPFS Desktop](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/ipfs-desktop/) and [IPFS Companion](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/ipfs-companion/). Then, you will have direct access to IPFS, which is more performant and reliable.\n\nNow, after you have chosen between Public Gateway and Local IPFS Daemon, you are ready to open STC, but before that, you need to learn its name in IPFS network. IPFS provides non-human-readable identifiers called CIDs for all stored entities which are unique for every stored entity and also is generated automatically.\n\nEvery particular version of the STC has its own identifier. It's important to underline that CIDs are immutable, so visiting the site by its CID means you will get the same version of the site every time. But what if we add new features or upload new papers to STC? New versions of STC will have new CIDs and to help you find the actual CIDs of new versions, we have registered the domain name: [standard-template-construct.org](http://standard-template-construct.org)\n\nHere you are, opened the Standard Template Construct and ready to read. Put in the search bar DOI or text query, navigate through what you have found and download it.\n\n[Recent versions of STC](https://preview.redd.it/c6ixygoog8sa1.png?width=2412&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5c6fac36824f55a4e03fe35ebc1f893656e89b14)\n\n**How to help us?**\n\n*Easy mode*\n\n* You may join [our Telegram](https://t.me/nexus_search) where we publish DOI-CIDs lists which is enough to help us with seeding and to start your own library.

However, if you are a SciHub torrent seeder, you can unpack scimag zip files, hash them individually, and organize their seeding.

Ça nourri le désespoir par contre. Le nihilisme. L'absence de victoire</p>\n    <p>C'est un peu comme les cyber activistes qui ont porté #pizzagate au nue, qui en ont fait toute une cabale politique et religieuse, alors que tout, exclusivement tout était assis sur des fondations en cartons, ça ne reposait sur rien, c'était de la de désinformation armée</p>\n    <p>Pour soi-disant lutter contre la pédocriminalité mais en fait, ça ne faisait que servir leur propre biais politique et leur théorie de conspiration et ce faisant, ça prend tout l'espace et ça invisibilise les vrais victimes, les vrais combats, ça les noient dans le néant.</p>\n    <p>Alors oui, il y a des convergences d'intérêts qui peuvent donner l'apparence qu'il y a connivence, complicité et qui sert un grand montage pour soit-disant \"expliquer\" la folie qui ressort de l'apparence de ces thèses, mais elle ne sont qu'une manière qu'à le cerveau</p>\n    <p>De pendre des faits complexes, des histoires diverses et variées, des affaires juridiques et des cas bien précis pour en former une nébuleuse qui a l'air d'avoir du sens de par sa masse et ses apparences d'interconnexions.<br />\n<br />\nMais qui dit apparence ne dit pas réalité.</p>\n    <p>Face à la complexité de la réalité, la réponse ne devrait pas être de tirer un grand coup de crayon pour dire : voilà l'état des lieux mais plutôt de zoomer sur le graphique et d'exposer ce qu'il y a à exposer et leurs interconnexions quand il y en a et de s'occuper de chaque</p>\n    <p>Cas un par un, plutôt que de prendre la masse de toute la folie qu'on perçoit via nos flux d'informations et la capacité de notre cerveau de simplifier la complexité pour la rendre digestible et d'en faire un tout amorphe. Ce faisant on rend invisible l'unicité de chaque cas</p>\n    <p>Ça ne fait en rien avancer les combats, les luttes, ça fait l'effet opposé, tout se noie dans une masse impossible à combattre comme une overdose d'information qui paralyse au lieu d'informer et de permettre d'articuler l'action.<br />\n<br />\nBref.. C'est un plaidoyer pour ne pas tout brûler</p>\n    <p>Moi même je tombe dans le panneau, je me pense pas du tout au dessus de tout cela, j'y succombe à ma façon pour plusieurs raisons par moment mais j'essaie à chaque fois de dézoomer et de regarder là où moi je peux agir, faire avancer les choses et c'est par l'action que ça change</p>\n    <p>On va pas remporter ces batailles en s'imaginant qu'elle sont extérieure à nous même en fait, ces dérives font partie de nos systèmes, on va pas les nettoyer au karcher et puis hop c'est réglé, non je pense que c'est plus complexe que ça et que pour guérir nos sociétés</p>\n    <p>Il faut les régénérer, il faut s'y mêler, sortir de la position du spectateur qui constate les dégâts et s'immiscer dans le réel et essayer par différentes stratégies de changer les choses. Aucune lutte avant nous n'a été gagnée sans ce travail de fond, c'est pareil pour la cause</p>\n    <p>Des abus sexuels, de la pédocriminalité, de la violence faite aux femmes, du harcèlement et en somme de toute les injustices qui plombent la condition humaine.

On était là, 2 ans après la condamnation juridique de Robert Spatz alias Lama Kunzang.<br />\n<br />\n12 ans après la réception du réquisitoire</p>\n    <p>6 ans après 2 lettres de parties civiles envoyées directement au \"directeur spirituel\" de OKC, le dénommé Rabjam Rinpoche.<br />\n<br />\nJe crois que naïvement une partie de l'enfant en moi, croyais gentiment que tout cela aurait suffit pour faire prendre des positions qui tantôt se cachait</p>\n    <p>Derrière la procédure judiciaire pour ne pas s'exprimer avant le verdict, l'appel et enfin le rejet de cet appel en 2022 et sinon se cachait derrière la culture tibétaine qui ne critique pas ouvertement autrui.<br />\n<br />\nEn fait, la lâcheté est et était au rendez-vous, tout du long.</p>\n    <p>Alors, oui, d'aucun ont intercedé en notre faveur, d'aucun ont même porté nos voix, sans que rien leur soit demandé auprès de ceux qui ont accès aux oreilles de ces \"grand maître\" le fameux Rabjam ici plus haut, mais aussi Jigme Khyentse (Chanteloube) et son frère Pema Wangyal</p>\n    <p>Pour ces deux derniers, fils du grand Kangyour Rimpoche, gardiens du Bouddhisme Tibétain et d'une lignée dite ininterrompue, pourtant salie depuis les années 1970 par la dérives sectaires de Lama Kunzang, qu'ils laissé faire, voire ont été les architectes, même indirecte de ce</p>\n    <p>dernier. Et puis quand ils ont eu des doutes (les 3 frères, fils du dit Kangyour) ils sont restés en silence, le plus âgé a même continuer à visiter Spatz jusqu'à au moins milieux des années 2000,tres certainement 2004 pour des raisons pas très Bouddhistes d'ailleurs. Bref..</p>\n    <p>6 mois après la sortie du Bouddhisme, la loi du silence, ces gens comptaient sur les victimes, non seulement pour leur faire prendre conscience de leurs responsabilités, mais aussi pour faire la communication de lettres de \"reconnaissance\" publique des faits, lettres qui malgré</p>\n    <p>Les aller et retours, n'était et ne sont jusqu'à preuve du contraire que l'ombre de ce qu'elle prétendaient être : une reconnaissance, une prise de conscience, une prise de position claire et net.<br />\n<br />\nHors on a assisté à la cuisine d'une ébauche qui malgré les efforts n'était pas</p>\n    <p>Au tiers de la hauteur de la situation, sans parler du fait que ces messieurs, du haut des cieux dans lesquels ils se meuvent, comptaient sur les victimes, les survivants de leurs dérives même indirecte, pour faire leur communication.<br />\n<br />\n Hier, la patience est arrivé à son terme</p>\n    <p>Alors comme il y a 6 mois, je le redis, il est encore trop tôt pour oser espérer une prise de position forte, Claire, pas tant de Matthieu Ricard, qui dans le fond n'est pas ou moins responsable de cette épave aux terribles conséquences, mais bien de ces \"grands maîtres\"</p>\n    <p>Car c'est bien de la lâcheté dont il s'agit, un manque de courage, de lucidité, de discernment qui entache tout le bouddhisme Tibétain, du moins en Occident.<br />\n<br />\nIl s'avère qu'un nouveau procès arrive en France, le procès final de la dérive sectaire nuisible OKC et son gourou.</p>\n    <p>Hors, jusqu'à preuve du contraire, ce n'est pas sur les banc de la justice que le Bouddhisme Tibétain sera jugé, en effet il n'a aucune existence juridique légale en France, et même ses institutions (UBE, UBF, UBB) ne sont que des paravent à subsides d'états pour décorer le BT</p>\n    <p>Et donc.. C'est sur la place publique que le Bouddhisme Tibétain sera jugé.<br />\n<br />\nC'est les Bouddhistes, encore atteint de discernment qui le jugeront.<br />\n<br />\nC'est les donations et les offrandes qui vont se tarir et là, comme toute machine humaine, le Bouddhisme Tibétain peut être écoutera</p>\n    <p>Et c'est aussi le \"grand public\" ce fameux public qui de Chanteloube, Paris, Madrid, Lisbonne, Bruxelles et j'en passe en passant par Davos est encore imprégné par le mythe d'un Bouddhisme Tibétain qui en fait n'a jamais existé et peut-être n'aurait jamais dû exister sous cette</p>\n    <p>Forme qui est la sienne et bien décrite dans le documentaire ARTE Bouddhisme, la loi du silence : des préfectures virtuelles décentralisée sans garde fous ni aucune responsabilité qui ont fait 60 ans de ravages à peine connu des Occidentaux (Shambhala, RIGPA, OKC) Pour n'en citer</p>\n    <p>Que 3 de ces Pires dérives criminelles, qui encore aujourd'hui broient des vies et produisent de la souffrance tout en vendant du Bonheur et la quête de \"la nature de l'esprit\".<br />\n<br />\nLe Temple ne se nettoiera pas de l'intérieur, il s'écroulera par sa propre inertie. C'est inéluctable</p>\n    <p>À propos de lâcheté, on peut aussi parler du Dalai-Lama, qui en 2018, alors que je le visite pour le confronter à son attestation de légitimité utilisé par la OKC en tribunal pour se \"défendre\" sur le fond en invoquant le Bouddhisme Tibétain, fait 4 promesses, non tenue jusqu'ici</p>\n    <p>Alors, on pourra certainement critiquer ma manière, mes stratégies, mais on pourra pas dire que je n'ai pas essayé, que je n'ai pas remué ciel et terre, jusqu'à Dharamsala pour que Conscience se fasse.<br />\n<br />\nEt puis rien.. Juste rien.. Ou tellement peu. Tellement minable. Petit.</p>\n    <p>Du coup ce soir, même si je sais que d'aucun essaye encore interceder, Matthieu Ricard en première ligne, je tiens à dire clairement que pour moi, pour <a class=\"entity-mention\" href=\"https://twitter.com/OKCinfor\">@OKCinfor</a> la balle est dans leurs camps, à eux d'agir, nous, nous avons à vivre, on est trop occupé pour faire leur travail.</p>\n    <p>Qu'ils assument, qu'ils constatent par eux même que \"l'air a convertir\" n'est plus une bande de hippie en perdition sans discernement et que dorénavant si Bouddhisme il devrait y avoir en Occident, c'est peut être celui d'origine, sans la surcouche toxique du bouddhisme tibétain</p>\n    <p>De toute façon ces derniers sont bien trop occupés à préparer d'autre marchés, comme des banquiers, des spéculateurs et des investisseurs convoiteraient des marchés juteux à exploiter.

Tout le monde le dit.</p>\n    <p>Les associations, les ministres, les députés, les survivants, les victimes et pourtant ça reste lettre morte, rien ne change ou très peu, si peu, alors qu'à l'heure où j'écris ces lignes des enfants sont abusés en France, en Belgique ailleurs, internats, écoles, églises, temples</p>\n    <p>Des femmes, des mères sont violentées devant leurs enfants, des institutions articule et rajoute de la friction et des injustices là où elle devrait aider, guérir, cicatriser, protéger et incarner l'intégrité et la transparence face à des dérives criminelles.<br />\n<br />\nParfois j'ai</p>\n    <p>Souvent j'ai l'impression que de continuer cette bataille est peine perdue, les gens veulent juste mater un bon film, déconner, s'amuser, bref vivre.. Et que ces batailles, ces \"problèmes\" viennent déranger leur quiétude, un peu comme si se lever contre les injustices était</p>\n    <p>Dérangeant pour les autres, un fardeau d'y penser, un Calvaire d'y être confronté.<br />\n<br />\nQuel luxe ! J'aimerais pouvoir juste me débrancher et laisser ça derrière moi, mais le faire serait me trahir jusque dans les profondeurs de mon être, ça serait l'ultime trahison, envois moi même.</p>\n    <p>Alors je continue mon bout de chemin, quitte à perdre des amis, quitte à avancer seul en fait, comme un Yak solitaire, indétournable de sa piste, avec au fond des yeux la certitude que ses montagnes doivent être soulevée, ces causes visibilisées, ces crimes pourchasser à jamais.</p>\n    <p>Tellement d'injustices, tellement de crimes, tellement de lois à changer, tellement de travail à faire pour que dans 10 ans, si une survivantes a besoin d'aller en justice alors qu'il ou elle n'en a pas les moyens, qu'une structure puisse leur venir en aide et payer, oui payer</p>\n    <p>Des procès, littéralement sponsoriser le travail en justice de survivants et survivantes qui en plus de devoir survivre, doivent encore trouver les moyens d'accéder à la justice qui est censée être un droit.<br />\n<br />\nSans parler de payer des soins psy et tout autre forme de soutien</p>\n    <p>En fait, il y a un tel chantier à faire quand je me regarde dans le miroir, après avoir perdu 7 ans de ma vie dans les méandres de la Justice belge et depuis 2017 dans les méandres de la nouvelle instruction française, je me dis que c'est pas tenable, c'est pas possible.</p>\n    <p>Qu'il faut créer une brique de plus, même si elle est temporaire, mais il faut créer une brique de plus pour articuler l'accès à la justice pour les victimes.<br />\n<br />\nTout ce qui existe en terme de conseil, avocat pro deo etc.. N'est pas suffisant.<br />\n<br />\nJe le vois dans mon propre parcours</p>\n    <p>Pour <a class=\"entity-mention\" href=\"https://twitter.com/OKCinfor\">@OKCinfor</a> si on avait pas eu l'humanité de Dimitri Debeco à notre service jamais on serait arrivé là où l'on s'est arrêté en Belgique. Jamais. Face aux obstacles et aux limites d'un \"commis d'office\" on aurait abandonné, on aurait pas eu les compétences pour gagner.</p>\n    <p>Donc, il faut non seulement avoir accès à des avocats exceptionnels (et ça peut coûter très cher) comme en plus il faut avoir accès à de l'assistance psychologique, il faut un accompagnement psy pour ne pas que la réouverture des cicatrices se transforme en deuxième traumatisme</p>\n    <p>Je le vois avec une amie Italienne qui est dans ses propres démarches, c'est impossible pour une femme seule (même avec travail temps plein) de se payer la quantité de séances psy nécessaire à une reconstruction avant, pendant après une procédure judiciaire. Notre système n'est</p>\n    <p>Juste pas prévu pour. En Belgique on a droit à 16 séances psy remboursée par an. Quelqu'un qui est dans une procedure juridique intense, avec traumas et abus sexuels, il va devoir en faire 1 séance par semaine. Un procès peut durer 8 mois<br />\n<br />\nJe vous laisse faire les comptes.</p>\n    <p>Notre système n'est pas prévu n'est pas dessiné et n'est pas pensé pour ces cas de figure.<br />\n<br />\nDeux solutions, de un on change et on adapte les lois pour faciliter les victimes (pas les accusés) ou de deux, c'est le privé qui s'occupe de tout en créant une structure propre.</p>\n    <p>Perso je suis de l'avis que non seulement le droit doit évoluer, la prescription abolie, le \"traitement\" des justiciables radicalement repensé, le \"prix\" d'un viol radicalement augmenté etc..mais aussi les indemnités radicalement revue à la hausse.<br />\n<br />\nPourquoi ?</p>\n    <p>En sortant d'une procédure judiciaire, même accompagnée par un psy, la victime va prendre plusieurs mois ou années à s'en remettre : quel est l'impact du processus judiciaire sur les victimes ? Pas l'impression que les lois aujourd'hui en tiennent compte.</p>\n    <p>J'ai plus l'impression que \"les droits de la défense\", donc des accusés, sont plus importants et mieux défendu que les droits des parties civiles, des victimes.<br />\n<br />\nJe pense que la majorité de la société n'a aucune idée de l'enfer que c'est, de passer par une procédure judiciaire.</p>\n    <p>Je pense que les accusés, en Belgique notamment, bénéficie directement de la non couverture et non médiatisation des affaires juridiques comme c'est le cas dans ce pays (sauf pour les terroristes et Dutroux) les autres, c'est bien discret, à l'arrière plan, après le foot.</p>\n    <p>Pour moi, en Belgique, le travail de la justice est en partie inconnu par la toute grande majorité de la population. Pareil pour le monde politique ! Qui parmis les élus sait ce que c'est que de passer par une procédure judiciaire en tant que partie civile ?<br />\n<br />\nFin.</p>\n    <p><span class=\"entity-mention-threadreader\"><a class=\"entity-mention entity-mention-first\" href=\"https://twitter.com/threadreaderapp\">@threadreaderapp</a> unroll</span></p>\n    <p>Roh les fautes d'orthographes !!

Blablabla \"cross culture différence\" 💭</p>\n    <p>Et j'arrive à la minute 10 et je n'ai pas du tout envie de me taper 6 minutes de relativisme inductif pour Bouddhistes en mal de perception qui ont besoin d'être téléguidé comme des enfants pour savoir si oui on non, si c'est réel, cette vidéo est appropriée ou pas.<br />\n<br />\nBref..</p>\n    <p>Voilà pour la perspective de Thubten Chodron, une Bouddhiste occidentale, qui a tellement bien ingéré les mécanismes d'auto psyché défense de la \"culture tibétaine\" qu'elle se fait le chantre de ce comportement \"normal\" pour un @DalaiLama c'est juste 🤯 WTF</p>\n    <p>@rMdes_ Un mélange d’arguments tout pétés (sur l’IA), de religion et de bons vieux arguments servis pour défendre l’agresseur (mais non, voyons, ce n’était pas son intention, il ne peut pas, c’est le DL en plus), ce serait pathétique si ce n’était pas écouté.</p>\n</div>\n",
